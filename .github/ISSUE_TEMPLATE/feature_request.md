**Important Note**
This project is designed to work with documents that EXACTLY match the Keep a Changelog reference document at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/v1.0.0/CHANGELOG.md

As a result, any requests to support changes to formatting, no matter how small, will not be considered, apologies.

If you are asking to have any sort of format change made, you should be submitting that request to https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog, not this repo. If there is a Keep a Changelog 2.0.0 or such released in the future, this project will be updated to support that format.
